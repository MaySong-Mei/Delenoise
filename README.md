When using a microscope, we may face challenges in obtaining clear images due to hardware limitations, resulting in poor-quality output. To tackle this issue, we plan to employ the diffusion model in our project. Our aim is to enhance the quality of the image while maintaining its biological plausibility. With this approach, we hope to improve the visibility of crucial biological features without inventing non-existent features.
